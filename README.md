# Outdoor Environment Rendering
This is a hobby repo where I implement interesting graphics programming techniques and algoritms.

## Support
- [x] Shadow mapping  
- [x] GPU particles (used for snow) 
- [x] Wind driven grass fields
- [x] Loading and drawing .fbx-models (using [OpenFBX](https://github.com/nem0/OpenFBX/blob/master/src/ofbx.h))

## Wishlist / Long term TODO
- [ ] Integrate [water simulation](https://github.com/raaavioli/WaterRendering)
- [ ] [Atmospheric scattering](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems2/part-ii-shading-lighting-and-shadows/chapter-16-accurate-atmospheric-scattering)
- [ ] [Interactive grass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKX45_riWQA), reacting to movement and better control of wind 
- [ ] Terrains, procedural(?), height-map based (?), marching cubes (?).
- [ ] PBR Materials
- [ ] SSAO
- [ ] [SSRO](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1667146.1667188)
- [ ] Anti aliasing (TAA or MSAA)
- [ ] Deferred rendering with G-Buffer for multi-light support
- [ ] Cascaded shadow mapping
I could make this list long, but this is just to keep me reminded that there are always things to do.
